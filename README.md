# Prompt Engineering For Developers

The repo is created for practising the execises shared by the excellent course: [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) from DeepLearning.AI.

However, it is not restricted to OpenAI API only such as ChatGPT and GPT4. You can see that I started with `gpt4all-j`, an open source large language model.
